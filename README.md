## Build
If you want to build all the notes yourself, you an either

- Go to one of the submodule-repositories, clone it and follow the corresponding instructions there. You can do this for each of the courses
- Clone this repository. Then you can 
    - `make init` : This will initialize submodules
    - `make all` : This will compile all scripts of the submodules

## License
The preamble of these documents is (mainly) taken from https://github.com/gillescastel/university-setup and published under the MIT-License. The corresponding part of the preamble is marked and the license is included.
The custom packages are 'self-written', feel free to use or customise them for your own wishes.
This work is itself licensed under MIT, which means you can freely use, distribute, modify or even sell the code found here, as long as you include this license as well.

## Errors
If you find errors, content-wise but as well typos, please let me know so that I can correct them. Either contact me directly (e.g. via [Mail](mailto:s6mnkess@uni-bonn.de)), use the 'Issues feature' here on GitHub or even make a Pull Request if you corrected the errors yourself. Of course, feedback is also greatly appreciated. Please 

## Write-up
I use the setup from https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets (Vim + UltiSnips) to write up these lecture notes and https://github.com/gillescastel/university-setup to structure these, though i customised them heavily for my purposes. Also, the [Neo-Layout](https://neo-layout.org) comes in handy when writing LaTeX as it enables to type special characteres and greek letters directly and easily.
